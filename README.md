# Horror Escape

## Project Overview

"Horror Escape" is a thrilling horror game designed to immerse players in a spine-chilling environment filled with unexpected events. The game features various terrifying scenarios such as RatRush, Skull Shower, and lights turning off, creating an intense and engaging experience for players.

## Unique Implementation

The standout feature of "Horror Escape" is the implementation of the Observer Pattern using Unity. The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that facilitates communication between game objects. It allows one object (the subject) to broadcast messages, which other objects (subscribers) can listen to and react accordingly. This pattern is particularly useful in game development for managing events and interactions between different game components.

## Key Features

**RatRush:** A sudden rush of rays that adds to the horror element.

**Skull Shower:** An eerie event where skulls rain down, heightening the fear factor.

**Lights Turning Off:** Sudden darkness to create a suspenseful atmosphere.

## Observer Pattern in Action

In "Horror Escape," the Observer Pattern is used to invoke various game events. This design pattern was a challenging yet rewarding aspect of the project, providing a valuable learning experience. By using the Observer Pattern, the game ensures that the broadcaster (subject) does not need to be concerned with the actions of the subscribers after a message is broadcasted, leading to a more modular and maintainable codebase.

## Learning Experience

Implementing the Observer Pattern in Unity was both a challenge and a significant learning opportunity. It allowed for a deeper understanding of design patterns and their practical applications in game development, ultimately enhancing the overall quality and functionality of "Horror Escape."
